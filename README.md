## The Book Rental Backend

This repository contains the backend code for a book rental application built using Node.js and tested with Jest. The backend exposes a RESTful API for renting books and includes endpoints for managing user accounts, authentication, and book inventory. The code is organized into different modules for handling different aspects of the application, such as the database, the API routes, and the middleware. The repository also includes scripts for setting up the development and production environments and for deploying the code to a server. The backend uses MongoDB Atlas as the database.
